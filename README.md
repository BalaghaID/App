# [BalaghaID App (v0.1.0)](https://github.com/BalaghaID/App/tree/v0.1.0)
### Part of the [BALAGHA Score Project](https://project.balaghascore.com)

An interactive application for identifying Arabic rhetorical devices through guided decision-making.


&nbsp;
## ℹ️ About
The **BalaghaID App** uses a structured decision tree based on the [Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy (ARDT v0.1.1)](https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/tree/v0.1.1), guiding users step by step through diagnostic questions that progressively narrow down the rhetorical phenomenon under analysis.

Rather than relying on prior terminological knowledge, BalaghaID focuses on observable linguistic features and functional cues, allowing users to arrive at a principled identification of rhetorical devices.

BalaghaID is configured to guide users toward principled identification of the [94 rhetorical devices](https://balagha-id.app/list) defined in the ARDT, spanning the classical domains of [ʿilm al-maʿānī](https://al-balagha.com/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Arabic_Rhetoric#A), [ʿilm al-bayān](https://al-balagha.com/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Arabic_Rhetoric#B), and [ʿilm al-badīʿ](https://al-balagha.com/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Arabic_Rhetoric#C), as well as recognised [negative rhetorical effects](https://al-balagha.com/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Arabic_Rhetoric#D).

### 🎯 Purpose
BalaghaID is a decision-support tool intended to assist human annotators in systematically applying the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy. It does not perform automatic rhetorical detection. 

In research contexts, BalaghaID may be used during manual annotation to reduce oversight, improve consistency, and operationalise complex taxonomic distinctions.

BalaghaID is designed for researchers, students, and practitioners of Arabic rhetoric, digital humanities, and related fields, and serves both as an analytical tool and as a pedagogical aid.

BalaghaID forms part of the broader [BALAGHAScore framework](https://project.balaghascore.com/), which aims to operationalise [Arabic rhetoric](https://al-balagha.com/) for systematic analysis and comparative study.

Users are invited to explore [BalaghaID](https://Balagha-ID.app), apply it to their own texts, and incorporate it into research, teaching, or exploratory rhetorical analysis. Feedback, methodological discussion, and critical engagement are welcome as the tool continues to develop.
